            Leila Khoury (she/they) is a multidisciplinary artist based in
            Cleveland, Ohio. Khoury received her BFA in Interdisciplinary
            Sculpture from the Maryland Institute College of Art and her Master
            of Architecture and Certificate in Historic Preservation from the
            School of the Art Institute of Chicago.
          </p>

          <p>
            Khoury’s graduate thesis, <i>A Soulful Body: The Immigration and
            Placemaking of Arabs in Detroit,</i> chronicles the history and built
            environment of Detroit’s Arab American communities. In addition to
            highlighting buildings that were adaptively reused by refugee and
            immigrant groups in the last century, <i>A Soulful Body</i> speaks to the
            ways in which the groups continually carve out space for themselves
            in spite of the displacement they’ve endured in both historic and
            contemporary contexts. <i>A Soulful Body</i> was selected to be published
            by 
			 <a class="body-link"
href="https://www.annatararova.com/empress"
target="_blank">Empress Editions</a> through their juried Artist Book Residency in
            August 2020.
          </p>

          <p>
            Khoury currently serves as Creative Director of an ongoing research
            project called the
						 <a class="body-link"
href="https://cc-archives.com"
target="_blank">Cleveland Community Archives.</a> An interactive
            website and storytelling platform, the Archives houses a growing
            collection of oral histories that document Cleveland’s DIY and
            experimental art spaces, mutual aid organizations, LGBTQIA+ venues,
            and other non-commercial spaces that have dissipated due to
            gentrification and other systemic acts of erasure.
          </p>

          <p>
            Khoury’s work has been featured in solo and group exhibitions in
            Cleveland and Columbus, OH; Chicago, IL; Baltimore, MD; Washington,
            D.C.; Pittsburgh, PA; Waeukesha, WI; and Subhan, Kuwait. Between
            June and September 2018, two works by Khoury were featured in the
            National Museum of Women in the Arts’ exhibition series, <i>Women to Watch.</i>
