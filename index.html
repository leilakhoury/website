            <b>ANDRIA:</b>&emsp; Before Bounce opened, there was a bar called
            The Cage on Detroit Avenue. That was such a good bar, it was hoppin
            seven nights a week. I did shows there, and I did shows at a little
            bar further up the street called Sexx. The owner of Bounce was
            looking for somebody to MC the shows at Bounce before it even
            opened. He came to one of my shows up the street and heard me MC,
            then he asked me if I wanted to come down there and work. And I said
            yeah. Nobody knew Bounce was gonna be as big as it was and knew the
            premise behind it. He didn’t understand the need that Cleveland had
            for a big open space like that for everybody to gather. He didn’t
            think it was gonna be as successful as it was, I don’t think. And I
            was there from the time it opened and worked there for ten years.
          </p>
          <p>
            In between that time, we used to do shows in the little room on the
            side called Pump. I had to do two shows a night there on Friday and
            Saturday, and that place would be packed, stupid packed, an ocean of homosexuals,
            and you could barely breathe in that room, and I begged him,
            <i>begged him</i>, please open up the dancefloor side so we can do
            shows over there. He said okay, if you pack that room for a month,
            I’ll do it. Three weeks later he had the dance room side open. And

              >Kari Nickels</a
            >, I begged her to come and work there, and she worked
            there until they closed. Kari Nickels is one of the foundation
            members of that damn place. Without her, I don’t think shows would
            have survived as long as they did there. Bounce was nice because it
            was for 18 and over, and the fledgling kids got a chance to go, and got a
            chance to see, and got a chance to experience all of the rich,
            eclectic gay history and gay community that Cleveland has. And it
            was the last big bar, big dance bar there in town. Because I really
            don’t think that they have anything of that magnitude there now, do
            they?

          <p>
            <b>LEILA:</b>&emsp; From what I understand, drag has just been
            integrated into different straight bars and venues or smaller LGBTQ+
            bars. But there isn’t one central spot to my knowledge.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>ANDRIA:</b>&emsp; That’s so sad! There was a time where drag was
            so wanted and so desired in Cleveland. I worked seven nights a week,
            and I was doing nine shows a week. I could have done more if I
            wanted to, but there was just not enough time or days in a month.
            And everybody made money. Everyone did. The weekend shows at Bounce
            were phenomenal. They were packed, people just stupid packed in
            there. The queens made hella money and the atmosphere was great. It
            was straight, gay, bisexual, didn’t matter. Everybody was in there.
            And Cleveland needed that so bad. The Grid had closed, Numbers had
            closed, and most of them were downtown. Cleveland was going through
            this change, this metamorphosis, and Bounce came at a great time and
            filled such a good need there. I had no idea why the original owner
            of Bounce had sold the bar or gave it up. I thought it was a great
            bar and a great time for everybody.

            Drag was never intended for anyone to make a living off of. And if
            it was, you’re one of the very few. Now I have managed over the
            years to make a living off drag, but I’ve done it for so long that I
            can work where I want to, and bars are very kind to me and I’ve made
            a name for myself in the 25 years that I’ve been doing it. But a lot
            of girls now, a lot of the newcomers, a lot of the fledgling girls,
            what are they gonna do? Where are they gonna hone their crafts at?
            You have to be able to give some stage time before anyone will pay
            you to get on stage, but it’s a catch-22 now, especially with
            Corona. Nobody’s gonna give you a chance to get on stage if you
            haven’t proven yourself, and you can’t prove yourself unless you get
            on stage. It’s so sad. Columbus is much better for drag than
            Cleveland is, there’s always something or someone doing a show here,
            and Axis is very good for that, they’re very good for making shows,
            making sure that all the queens that work for them can make money
            and say sustained in this screwed up time. And Cleveland needs that
            too, Cleveland has a bevy of great entertainers.
          </p><br/>
          <p>
            <b>LEILA:</b>&emsp;Are you still in touch with
            the Cleveland community from back then?
          </p><br/>
          <p>
            <b>ANDRIA:</b>&emsp;Oh yeah. Those are friends I made in my twenties
            and they’re still my friends now. And I keep in contact with
            everybody. Like Kari Nickels—she was always the mainstay in the
            community, and always made money, and people always flocked to her
            shows. And when Bounce closed for good and they didn’t need her
            anymore, it’s so sad, so sad. If I had the money, I would throw it
            into that place in a minute.

            <b>ANDRIA:</b>&emsp;With Corona around, I hate to say this, but I
            think that the time of going to sit down and see shows and enjoy
            shows like we used to, has come and gone. This is the harbinger of
            what it’s become, and how we’re going to have to change our whole
            way of entertainment, and how we’re going to convey drag and
            everything else. I mean down here in Columbus, you have to wear a
            full-face shield, there’s no hand-to-hand tipping, people can’t get
            out of their seats, it’s very sterile and very—ugh. It’s like doing
            drag in a study hall room. It’s very, very weird. And it’s taken the
            intimacy out of it. I’ve always liked that—being on stage and being able to look into somebody’s face, and get
            close and personal with them, and talk to them. You know, the
            one-on-one. And you can’t have that now… This is new territory for
            everybody. And they’ve never, not in my lifetime, have they ever
            enforced quarantine, has anyone been this vigilant about an airborne
            pathogen.
          </p>
          <p>
            With all drag, drag changes. There’s an ebb and flow, different
            styles of drag change. I have my own

            >, me and Maria, and that’s how I’ve been fulfilling my drag outlet and making
            money doing what I like to do—which is being a talker. I get on
            there and talk like an idiot and say things that I shouldn’t, but
            nevertheless people enjoy it, so I do it anyway. Girls are doing
            numbers on Facebook and on Instagram, doing that in their living
            room, and people tip on Cash App and Venmo. I don’t think that’s
            going to go away anytime soon. If anything, I think it’s even going
            to get more involved with that. So that people don’t have to leave
            the comfort of their home to watch a drag show.&emsp;<i>[Note: Andria's Cash App handle is $Andria1000]</i>

          <br />
          <p>
            <b>ANDRIA:</b>&emsp;No! Nobody. And I’m telling you, especially
            being an MC, when I have to sit in a room with nobody other than my
            roommate, and I’m talking, I can’t tell whether what I’m saying
            lands or whether it falls flat, because there’s no participation
            from the audience, there’s no energy from anybody else in the room,
            because I’m the only person there. So I don’t know if it’s funny, I
            don’t know if it’s bad, I don’t know if it’s offensive, I don’t know
            anything. I just have to talk and hope that it’s funny and hope that
            people are enjoying it and hope that people are laughing. And I
            can’t tell whether people are enjoying it until it’s over with, so I
            can check the comments. So it’s weird, it’s really weird.

            <b>ANDRIA:</b>&emsp;You know, the thing about Bounce… the whole time
            I was there, there was never a lull in the crowd, in the people that
            came. I will tell you this; you did see a color switch in the
            clientele at the five- or six-year mark. It got a lot darker, which
            I enjoy—I’m Black myself, so enjoyed that. It got a lot darker, and
            then it leveled out. Bounce integrated a lot of the Black and white
            community together. Something that most cities in Ohio are still
            lacking. It was plagued by some of the violent side of Cleveland,
            you know, the gay community in Cleveland tends to be a little bit
            more aggressive than most, which I enjoy, again, because I’m a hot
            ass mess [laughs].

          <p><b>LEILA:</b>&emsp;No shame!</p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>ANDRIA:</b>&emsp;Girl, I could tell you stories from my youth
            that would make your skin crawl. But it was refreshing, because like
            I said, it was a safe place for everyone to go to and enjoy their
            craft. There was a big boom in female impersonation when Bounce
            first opened. There were a lot of girls that were more comfortable,
            just like, ‘oh there’s a place for me to go, Andria will always make
            sure that I’ll get on and do some kind of show.’ And I had a huge
            pool of entertainment to choose from when working those shows. There
            was a never a loss for girls, never. Which was good for me, but it
            was good for them too! It gave them a chance to prove their chops
            while they were on stage. And it was a good time, it was a really
            good time. And it brought together the community, I will say that.
            Bounce had a really good sense of community, and it hired almost
            exclusively from the community, so everyone that worked there was
            gay. They were good to work for because it’s gay-owned and operated,
            and they like to take care of their employees. I met some great
            people the whole time I was working there. I lost a few friends
            along the way, but that tends to happen with our lifestyle. You
            lived hard, you die fast. And that was another thing. There’s two
            types of people in the gay community—there are those who are
            responsible for the party, and those who enjoy the party. And those
            who are responsible for the party, party hard. Because without us,
            nobody else can enjoy their time. I’m an entertainer, people were
            coming to the bar to see me entertain. So we had a good time and did
            a lot of good time drugs, and did a lot of good time cocktails, not
            that anybody needs them, but that didn’t stop me. It was just par
            for the course then.

            When Bounce was open, it made you feel good about who you are, made
            you feel good about what was going on. Because there was always
            something to do, you always met your friends there, you could be
            friends with an eclectic group of people. Especially for me, I could
            go there and say hi to 50,000 people and never even get close to the
            middle of the bar. It takes you 45 minutes to walk through the
            place, and you were supposed to be there to work 20 minutes ago. And
            it’s like oh my god it’s too crowded, everyone was talking to me. It
            really made you feel like you were a star. And everybody felt that
            way when they walked in there. It was a big version of Cheers. It
            was wonderful, it was an absolutely wonderful place, and it did a
            lot for the community. It brought straight, gay, lesbian—which is
            another thing—a lot of lesbians have their own subculture, gay men
            have their subculture, Black gay men, Black gay women. Bounce
            brought everyone together, it didn’t matter, <i>did not matter</i>.
            It was such a good place for that.

            <b>LEILA:</b>&emsp;That’s so special. I feel like that’s so rare now. I think
            my generation is more isolated as a whole, so hearing about the joy and sense of community that space brought folks just reaffirms to me how important and necessary it was.

            Drugs Dancing and Drinks—that’s what they go out for—the four D’s.
            They can do drugs at home, they can find dick on their phone, they
            can dance on their phone, and they can do other things on their
            phone. They have no reason to go out anymore! Bars don’t have that
            mass appeal like they did.

            <b>LEILA:</b>&emsp;Oh my god you’re right, with dating apps now too. That makes
            me hope that after this pandemic runs its course, people would be so
            bored from being alone and on their phones that we’d be ready to
            have another revival of that.

            <b>ANDRIA:</b>&emsp;I’m hoping that if they get a grip on this pandemic, that
            people will be so happy to get up out of their houses that they will
            flood the bars. That would be nice.
